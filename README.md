# Crenshaw Police App & Network

## Project Overview
The Crenshaw Police App & Network is a system that connects people with emergency responders, like police, medics, and security, through a mobile app and local response points. The main goal is to help people get help faster during emergencies.

#How It Works
1. The App
   - Users create an account and can add family members or devices.
   - In an emergency, pressing the “Help” button sends your location and details to:
     - Nearby police or security patrols
     - Linked medical responders or ambulances
     - Family or trusted contacts

2. Local Response Points
   - In areas with poor mobile coverage, Crenshaw Points act as quick-response stations.
   - These could be near schools, taxi ranks, or local communities, working with local security or police.

3. Partners
   - Doctors, legal advisors, and other trusted service providers can register as verified responders.
   - Users can consult them through the app, either free or via a subscription.

# Why We Need It
Many communities in South Africa have slow or uncoordinated emergency services. This app helps:
- People get help faster.
- Families feel safer.
- Communities work together for better safety by combining digital tools with real people on the ground.

# How It Makes Money
- **Subscriptions:** Families or businesses pay monthly for extra features.
- **Per-use Fees:** Small payments for specific services like a legal call or ambulance.
- **Partnerships:** Work with insurance, medical, and security companies.
- **Community Sponsorships:** NGOs or local businesses can fund free access for some groups.

# Development Plan
Project Management: Use Trello to organise tasks.
- Tech Stack: TypeScript/React Native for the app, Node.js or Firebase for the backend.
- Pilot Program: Start in Tembisa, test it, get feedback, then expand to other areas.

Crenshaw Police connects people to help quickly and safely.
